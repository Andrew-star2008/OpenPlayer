# OpenPlayer
## I present to you my first Python application. Open Player is an application created as a replacement for the built-in Windows media player.

## We switched to the icon pack from Google. Thanks to Google for this.

>[!CAUTION]
**This version of the application is still being tested and various bugs and bugs are being searched for in it. Use this app at your own risk.**

**Also, I forgot to mention, when entering the folder with OpenPlayer, open the termenal folder, and enter this command into it.**
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**In all versions except v0.2.2 (including it too), I forgot to add the file **`requirements.txt`**, so please download it yourself from the source code and add it to the OpenPlayer folder so that the above command works properly.**

**If you don't have Python installed, install it at [```this link```](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

# Player Functions:
- selecting a track file (marked with a document icon).
- selecting a folder where all tracks are arranged for alternate playback (indicated by the folder icon).
- track start.
- track pause.
- switch tracks using the keyboard. That is: F12 (FN + F12) next track, F11 (FN + F11) previous.
- adjusting the playback volume.
