# OpenPlayer
## I present to you my first Python application. Open Player is an application created as a replacement for the built-in Windows media player

>[!CAUTION]
**This version of the application is still being tested and various bugs and bugs are being searched for in it. Use this app at your own risk**

# Player Functions:
- selecting a track file (marked with a document icon)
- selecting a folder where all tracks are arranged for alternate playback (indicated by the folder icon)
- track start
- track pause
- adjusting the playback volume
- that's (for now) it:)
